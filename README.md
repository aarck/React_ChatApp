1) First we need to create a server.js file to work upon the server side .
2) we can run both server and client side using concurrently npm module.
3)We will use chatkit for the chat application and thus we have to sign in to pusher and create new app to get the credentials.

Link to Chatkit Pusher:https://pusher.com/chatkit

4) we will be using server SDK to manage users and Client SDK to manage the client side interactions

For server SDK:npm install pusher-chatkit-server --save

5) The main Purpose of server is to get the POST request from user. And for this we will get POST request from a user on the server.
